INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SMCP

The package requires version 2.6 or newer of Python, and is built from
source, so the header files and libraries for Python must be
installed, as well as the core binaries. SMCP also requires the Python
extension modules CXVOPT 1.1.6 or later and CHOMPACK 2.0 or later.

The installation requires either ATLAS or BLAS + LAPACK. Using
architecture optimized ATLAS libraries is recommended and gives a
large performance improvement over standard BLAS & LAPACK
libraries. Both header files and libraries must be installed.

SMCP can be installed globally (for all users on a UNIX system) by
writing:

    python setup.py install

It can also be installed locally in the home directory by typing:

    python setup.py install --user
